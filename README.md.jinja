# {{project_name}}

This project is containerized using Docker and UV for dependency management, with separate setups for development and production.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- UV (installed inside the container)
- Python 3.11+ (optional for local dev tools)

## Development Setup

The development environment includes hot-reloading, dev dependencies, and linting. To build and run the dev container:

```bash
docker compose up --build

## Production Setup

The production container runs only production dependencies and is optimized for performance. To build and run the production container:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose-prod-override.yaml up --build
